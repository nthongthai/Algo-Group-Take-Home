I completed the implement-stack problem using C. Using doubly linked list,
I implemented the required 4 functions through struct Node with data, up,
and down to represent the stack. The testings for the functions includes 
3 tests total (stack creation, pushing elements, pop elements) where
peek/size is automatically tested in each of the tests.

Here are the results:

    Testing stack creation...
    Stack creation test passed.
    Testing push...
    Push elements test passed.
    Testing pop...
    Pop elements test passed.
